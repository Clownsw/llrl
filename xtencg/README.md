# xtencg: x86 assembler code generator for xten

The large number of boilerplates in [xten0](../xten0/src/asm/inst.rs) and [xten1](../xten1/asm/inst.llrl), corresponding to the x86 instruction set, are generated by the code generator implemented in this crate. [List of supported instructions](./supported-instructions.md) are also generated by this crate.

```bash
cargo run
```

xtencg uses [Askama](https://github.com/djc/askama) for code generation templates.

## src/x86.csv

The x86 instruction set is defined in csv format in [src/x86.csv](./src/x86.csv). This definition is imported from [StanfordPL/x64asm](https://github.com/StanfordPL/x64asm) with slightly modified.
