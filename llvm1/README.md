# llvm1: High-level LLVM API for llrl

LLVM-C API binding for llrl programming language.

Unlike [`llvm0`](../llvm0), `llvm1` does both binding C API functions and providing high-level abstract interfaces. Nevertheless, many functions are simply re-exports of the LLVM-C API with llrl's naming conventions.
